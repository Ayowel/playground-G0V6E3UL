# Welcome!

This C++ code should only be used to learn/experiment with classes and their implementations. Use the std::stack class implementation for actual program implementation.

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced C++ template](https://tech.io/select-repo/598)
